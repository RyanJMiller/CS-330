# CS-330
In working on this project, I've focused a lot more on attention to detail, and trying to extract as much information as possible from the resources I'm given to help ensure that I understand as much as possible before attacking the problem. My design process mainly consisted of wireframing shapes, I would use 3D graphing software to help me visualize the shapes structures. I would say the portion of this that I could best apply in the futre is the use of external tools. Generally when developing programs I try to break the problem down into chunks that are easier to tackle, and that was very important for this project, modularizing as much as I could made the process of fitting everything together so much easier and cleaner. I also made a point of making functions that I knew would be used frequently as reusable and inter compatable as possible. I believe it would have been very difficult to tackle this project if I hadn;t been effectiviely building portions of it for other assignments all semester, slowly adding more bells and whistles and improving. Computer Science as a field of study offers a robust framework for problem-solving which can be taken advantage of in many fields and goals. Computational graphics and visualizations, can empower me with skills like 3D modeling, simulation, and rendering which are useful in both academic and professional pursuits. Especially if I ever chose to pursue a more graphics focused career.
